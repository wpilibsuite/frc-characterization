Robot Drivetrain Characterization
=================================

This contains a test procedure that you can use to characterize your drivetrain
so that you can more accurately control and simulate it.

The test procedure involves running your robot in autonomous mode several times
while the data logger program gathers data. It is important to stop autonomous
mode when the robot is about to hit something, as the programmed autonomous mode
will NOT stop your robot automatically.

Sample robot code is available in several different variations.

* [Java](robot-java)
* [Java TalonSRX](robot-java-talonsrx)
* [Python](robot-python)
* [Python TalonSRX](robot-python-talonsrx)

Python robot code also has RobotPy physics support, so you can run the tests in
simulation if you want to see what the autonomous mode does! Unfortunately, it
does not model battery voltage realistically, so you will only get a kv value
from the simulation.

Prerequisites (PC)
------------------

Required to use the data_logger.py/data_analyzer.py scripts.

* Install Python 3.6 on your data gathering computer that will be connected to
  the robot's network
* Once finished, install matplotlib and statsmodels

On Windows the command to install matplotlib and statsmodels is as follows:

    py -3 -m pip install matplotlib statsmodels

Prerequisites (Robot)
---------------------

Your robot must have encoders attached to the drivetrain to measure the robot's
velocity.

If using a Python robot program, see the RobotPy installation documentation to
install software needed to deploy robot code, and how to install RobotPy on
your robot.

* http://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/index.html

If using a Java robot program, see the WPILIb screensteps documentation for
installing the necessary software on your computer.

Usage
-----

Preparation: make sure the code won't make your robot go crazy

1. Select one of the included robot programs, modify it to reflect your
   robot's drivetrain and encoder settings
2. Deploy the code to your robot
3. Ensure that pressing forward on a joystick makes your robot drive forward
4. If not, modify the 'inverted' flags in the code, repeat steps 2/3/4 until
   the robot drives forward
5. Open SmartDashboard/Shuffleboard/OutlineViewer and ensure that the
   l_encoder and r_encoder values are incrementing positively the correct
   distance in **feet** when you push the robot forward

Now you're ready to characterize your robot! On your data gathering computer,
launch data_logger.py (you can double-click it on Windows). Enter in your
team number or robot IP address when prompted.

Once the data logger has indicated that it has connected, do as prompted. Here's
what it will prompt you to do:

* Slow driving forward: Enable robot in autonomous mode, disable before the robot
  hits something
* Slow driving backward: Enable robot in autonomous mode, disable before the
  robot hits something
* Fast driving forward: Enable robot in autonomous mode, disable before the robot
  hits something
* Fast driving backward: Enable robot in autonomous mode, disable before the robot
  hits something

Once you have ran the 4 autonomous modes, the data files will be written to
this directory and a window should pop up that plots the data for you.

Next steps
----------

If using RobotPy and the pyfrc robot simulator, you can plug the generated
kv/ka/vintercept parameters into the TankModel for your robot for a more
realistic simulation experience.

Refer to the [original drivetrain characterization paper](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/media/papers/3402)
for ideas on how to use these empirically measured constants to improve control
of your drivetrain.
