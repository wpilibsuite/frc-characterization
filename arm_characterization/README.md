Robot Arm Characterization
==========================

This contains a test procedure that you can use to characterize a robot arm
so that you can more accurately control it.  The characterization will determine
best-fit parameters for the equation

![voltage balance equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V_{applied}=kS&plus;kCos\cdot\cos{\theta}&plus;kV\cdot\dot{\theta}&plus;kA\cdot\ddot{\theta})

where theta is the angle of the arm as measured from horizontal.

The test procedure involves running your robot in autonomous mode several times
while the data logger program gathers data. It is important to stop autonomous
mode when the arm is about to hit something, as the programmed autonomous mode
will NOT stop the arm automatically.

Sample robot code is available in several different variations.

* [Java](robot-java)
* [Java TalonSRX](robot-java-talonsrx)
* [Python](robot-python)
* [Python TalonSRX](robot-python-talonsrx)
* [C++](robot-cpp)
* [C++ TalonSRX](robot-cpp-talonsrx)

Prerequisites (PC)
------------------

Required to use the data_logger.py/data_analyzer.py scripts.

* Install Python 3.6 on your data gathering computer that will be connected to
  the robot's network
* Install `robot-characterization` from PyPI. If you're on Windows, run `py -3 -m pip install robot-characterization`

Prerequisites (Robot)
---------------------

Your robot must have an encoder attached to the arm to measure its
position and velocity.

If using a Python robot program, see the RobotPy installation documentation to
install software needed to deploy robot code, and how to install RobotPy on
your robot.

If using a Java or C++ robot program, see the WPILIb screensteps documentation for
installing the necessary software on your computer.

Usage
-----

Recording
=========

Preparation: make sure the code won't make your robot go crazy, and will perform the
calculations correctly

1. Select one of the included robot programs, modify it to reflect your
   robot's arm configuration and encoder settings
2. Deploy the code to your robot
3. Ensure that pressing forward on a joystick moves the arm in the desired
   direction\
4. If not, modify the 'inverted' flag in the code, repeat steps 2/3/4 until
   the arm moves as desired
5. Open SmartDashboard/Shuffleboard/OutlineViewer and ensure that the
   encoder values are incrementing positively by the correct distance in **degrees** 
   when you push the arm forward
6. Ensure that the `OFFSET` value in the robot code matches the physical offset of
   the robot arm from horizontal, in degrees.  This step is *very important*.

Now you're ready to characterize your robot! On your data gathering computer,
run `robot-characterization logger arm`. Enter in your
team number or robot IP address when prompted.

Once the data logger has indicated that it has connected, do as prompted. Here's
what it will prompt you to do:

* Slow motion forward: Enable robot in autonomous mode, disable before the arm
  hits something
* Slow motion backward: Enable robot in autonomous mode, disable before the
  arm hits something
* Fast motion forward: Enable robot in autonomous mode, disable before the arm
  hits something
* Fast motion backward: Enable robot in autonomous mode, disable before the arm
  hits something

Once you have ran the 4 autonomous modes, the data will be recorded in a json file
in this directory.

Analysis
========

Once you have recorded your data, launch the analysis GUI by running `robot-characterization analyzer arm`.
This will open a GUI that will analyze your data.  The left half of this GUI, labeled 
"Feedforward Analysis," will perform the linear regression and generate the aforementioned 
coefficients.

To calculate the characterization coefficients, first select the data file, and then click 
the "Analyze Data" button.  Various diagnostic plots will then become available, and the 
characterization coefficients and the r-squared for the fit will be displayed.  If problems 
are encountered, try modifying the minimum motion threshold or the window size for the 
acceleration calculation.

The right half of the GUI, labeled "Feedback Analysis," will generate optimal feedback 
gains for a simple PD controller via a Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR).  While the calculation 
is straightforward, the units of the gains depend critically on the controller setup - more 
detailed documentation on ensuring the correctness of units will be provided at a later date.
