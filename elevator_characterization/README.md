Robot Elevator Characterization
===============================

This contains a test procedure that you can use to characterize a robot elevator
so that you can more accurately control it.  The characterization will determine
best-fit parameters for the equation

![voltage balance equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V_{applied}=kG&plus;kFr\cdot&space;sgn(\dot{d})&plus;kV\cdot\dot{d}&plus;kA\cdot\ddot{d})

where d is the distance traveled by the elevator.

The test procedure involves running your robot in autonomous mode several times
while the data logger program gathers data. It is important to stop autonomous
mode when the elevator is about to hit something, as the programmed autonomous mode will NOT stop the elevator automatically.

Sample robot code is available in several different variations.

* [Java](robot-java)
* [Java TalonSRX](robot-java-talonsrx)
* [Python](robot-python)
* [Python TalonSRX](robot-python-talonsrx)

Prerequisites (PC)
------------------

The following is required to use the data_logger.py/data_analyzer.py scripts for all
of the characterization tools included in this repository:

* Install Python 3.6 on your data gathering computer that will be connected to
  the robot's network
* Once finished, install pynetworktables, matplotlib, scipy, and statsmodels

On Windows the command to install pynetworktables, matplotlib, scipy, and statsmodels 
is as follows:

    py -3 -m pip install pynetworktables matplotlib scipy statsmodels

Prerequisites (Robot)
---------------------

Your robot must have an encoder attached to the elevator to measure its
position and velocity.

If using a Python robot program, see the RobotPy installation documentation to
install software needed to deploy robot code, and how to install RobotPy on
your robot.

If using a Java robot program, see the WPILIb screensteps documentation for
installing the necessary software on your computer.

Usage
-----

Preparation: make sure the code won't make your robot go crazy, and will perform the
calculations correctly

1. Select one of the included robot programs, modify it to reflect your
   robot's elevator configuration and encoder settings
2. Deploy the code to your robot
3. Ensure that pressing forward on a joystick moves the elevator in the desired
   direction
4. If not, modify the 'inverted' flag in the code, repeat steps 2/3/4 until
   the arm moves as desired
5. Open SmartDashboard/Shuffleboard/OutlineViewer and ensure that the
   encoder values are incrementing positively by the correct distance in
   **feet** when you push the arm forward

Now you're ready to characterize your robot! On your data gathering computer,
run `robot-characterization logger elevator` (you can double-click it on Windows). Enter in your
team number or robot IP address when prompted.

Once the data logger has indicated that it has connected, do as prompted. Here's
what it will prompt you to do:

* Slow motion forward: Enable robot in autonomous mode, disable before the elevator
  hits something
* Slow motion backward: Enable robot in autonomous mode, disable before the
  elevator hits something
* Fast motion forward: Enable robot in autonomous mode, disable before the elevator
  hits something
* Fast motion backward: Enable robot in autonomous mode, disable before the elevator
  hits something

Once you have run the 4 autonomous modes, the data files will be written to
this directory and a window should pop up that plots the data for you and reports
your characterization values.

Analysis
========

Once you have recorded your data, launch the analysis GUI by running `robot-characterization analyzer elevator`  
This will open a GUI that will analyze your data.  The left half of this GUI, labeled 
"Feedforward Analysis," will perform the linear regression and generate the aforementioned 
coefficients.

To calculate the characterization coefficients, first select the data file, and then click 
the "Analyze Data" button.  Various diagnostic plots will then become available, and the 
characterization coefficients and the r-squared for the fit will be displayed.  If problems 
are encountered, try modifying the minimum motion threshold or the window size for the 
acceleration calculation.

The right half of the GUI, labeled "Feedback Analysis," will generate optimal feedback 
gains for a simple PD controller via a Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR).  While the calculation 
is straightforward, the units of the gains depend critically on the controller setup - more 
detailed documentation on ensuring the correctness of units will be provided at a later date.
